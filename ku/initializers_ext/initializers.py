def he_normal(seed=None, scale=2.):
    """He normal initializer.
    It draws samples from a truncated normal distribution centered on 0
    with standard deviation (after truncation) given by
    `stddev = sqrt(2 / fan_in)` where `fan_in` is the number of
    input units in the weight tensor.
      
    Parameters
    ----------
    seed: A Python integer. Used to seed the random generator.
    
    Returns
    -------
    An initializer.
